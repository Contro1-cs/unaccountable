### Week #1

On Day 1, we commenced our project by outlining all the features and creating a wireframe for the app's user interface. We utilized the excellent website [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) for wireframing and relied on Figma for prototyping. Establishing clear expectations, targets, and defining unique features were prioritized as crucial steps in the app development process.

### Stay tuned...
