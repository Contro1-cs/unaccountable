### Week #1

On Day 1, we commenced our project by outlining all the features and creating a wireframe for the app's user interface. We utilized the excellent website [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) for wireframing and relied on Figma for prototyping. Establishing clear expectations, targets, and defining unique features were prioritized as crucial steps in the app development process.

Later I started out with the basic frontend development of the app while [Pratik Asatkar](https://github.com/Pratik-Asatkar) works on the UI designs of the other
pages. Firebase integration is also done while completing the user onboarding process for the app. I prefer to do the bigger task first and then go down to the
smaller and smaller tasks. Just to track the progress we also have to maintain posting the tweets every day so that when we are done we can look back and appreciate what we have done. 


### Stay tuned...
